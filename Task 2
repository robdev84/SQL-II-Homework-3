Create one or more indexes to improve the following queries; prove that your index improves performance (using the "analyze" command):
a. select on_flag, count(*) from light_history where datetime = '2016-01-01 00:01:00' group by on_flag; 
b. select count(distinct first_name) from address a inner join people p on p.id = a.person_id where a.state = 'IL';
c. Two more queries we come up with in class (March 14th) - will be added here after class
