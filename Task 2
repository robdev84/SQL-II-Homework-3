Create one or more indexes to improve the following queries; prove that your index improves performance (using the "analyze" command):
a. select on_flag, count(*) from light_history where datetime = '2016-01-01 00:01:00' group by on_flag; 
b. select count(distinct first_name) from address a inner join people p on p.id = a.person_id where a.state = 'IL';
c. Two more queries we come up with in class (March 14th) - will be added here after class

Target timings and rows to aim for:
- 2a: 0.003 sec, 2002 r_rows
- 2b: 0.001 sec, 72 + 1 r_rows

select on_flag, count(*) from light_history where datetime = '2016-01-01 00:01:00' group by on_flag; 

analyze select on_flag, count(*) from light_history where datetime = '2016-01-01 00:01:00' group by on_flag;

Results

possible_keys = NULL
key = NULL
key_len = NULL
ref = NULL
Rows = 10157
r_rows = 10000
filtered = 100
r_filtered = 20.02

*******

create or replace index light_history_idx on light_history(datetime);

This took it down to 0.0072 seconds. Second run took it down to 0.0005 seconds! Subsequent runs stayed at 0.0072 seconds. 

Results

possible_keys = light_history_idx
key = light_history_idx
key_len = 6
ref = const
Rows = 2002
r_rows = 2002
filtered = 100
r_filtered = 100
