Create one or more indexes to improve the following queries; prove that your index improves performance (using the "analyze" command):

For March 14th:
select sum(watts) from light_history h inner join lights l on h.light_id = l.light_id  where h.on_flag = 1 and datetime in ('2016-01-01 00:10:00','2016-01-01 00:20:00','2016-01-01 00:30:00');

Target timings and rows to aim for: 0.028 sec, 3033 + 1 r_rows

create index light_id_idx on lights(light_id); 
analyze select sum(watts) from light_history h inner join lights l on h.light_id = l.light_id  where h.on_flag = 1;

Seems to help one of the tables

create index light_id_idx on light_history(light_id); 

drop index light_id_idx on light_history; 
create index light_id_idx on light_history(light_id, on_flag);
